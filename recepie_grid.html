                    <li>4 teaspoons minced garlic (4 cloves)</li>
                    <li>Salt and fresh ground black pepper, to taste</li>
                    <li>3-4 tablespoons butter, diced into small cubes (or ghee)</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley or cilantro</li>

                DIRECTIONS
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>To prepare the oven-baked salmon in foil packs: Preheat your oven to 425ºF (220ºC). Cut 2 sheets
                        of
                        14 by 12-inch (35 x 30 cm) heavy-duty aluminum foil then lay each piece separately on the
                        countertop. In a small bowl, combine the ingredients for the sauce: broth, lemon juice, and hot
                        sauce.</li>
                    <li>Season both sides of the salmon fillets with salt and pepper and divide salmon onto the aluminum
                        foil near the center then place trimmed asparagus to one side of the salmon, following the long
                        direction of the foil.</li>
                    <li>You can adjust salmon fillets seasoning with more salt and pepper, then sprinkle garlic on top.
                        Drizzle the garlic butter sauce generously over the salmon fillets and asparagus.</li>
                    <li>Divide butter pieces evenly among the foil packets, layering them over the salmon fillet and
                        asparagus.</li>
                    <li>Wrap salmon foil packets in and crimp edges together then wrap ends up. Don’t wrap too tight –
                        keep
                        a little extra space inside for heat to circulate.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the salmon foil packs to a baking sheet and bake salmon in the oven, sealed side upward
                        until salmon has cooked through, about 9 – 12 minutes. </li>
                    <li>Carefully unwrap the baked salmon in foil packets then drizzle with more lemon juice and garnish
                        with fresh parsley or cilantro and a slice of lemon. Enjoy!</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="notes">
                <div class="header-content">HOW LONG TO BAKE THE SALMON FOIL PACKS</div>
                <div class="notes-content">Salmon only needs 9-12 minutes of cooking time in a hot, preheated oven
                    (425°F –
                    220°C). Baking the salmon at a high temperature quickly roasts the exterior and seals in the natural
                    juiciness of the salmon, making it tender and moist. You can open the packets and broil/grill in the
                    last 2 minutes of cook time to get those crispy, golden charred edges. Since salmon filets can vary
                    in
                    size, keep an eye on the salmon towards the end of cooking since a thinner salmon fillet will cook
                    faster and a thicker filet such as a fattier farmed salmon, or a thick wild salmon fillet may take
                    longer to cook.</div>
                <div class="header-content">THE BEST TYPES OF SALMON TO MAKE BAKED SALMON IN FOIL</div>
                <div class="notes-content">Any of these types of salmon will work with this recipe: Atlantic Salmon,
                    Chinook
                    Salmon, Coho Salmon, Pink Salmon, Sockeye Salmon, or King Salmon. Overall, wild-caught salmon (not
                    farmed) is always better if you have the choice.</div>
                <div class="header-content">WHAT TO SERVE WITH THE BAKED SALMON RECIPE?</div>
                <div class="notes-content">Iыf you’re extra hungry, add a side of cauliflower rice, or roasted
                    vegetables.
                    Of
                    course, you can tuck a slice of tomato, some celery, or sliced carrot, in the foil packet to make it
                    more consistent. If you’re not on a keto diet, a good slice of country bread will soak up the
                    delicious
                    cooking juices of this easy salmon recipe.</div>
